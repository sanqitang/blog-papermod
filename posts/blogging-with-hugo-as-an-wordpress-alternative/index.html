While it is possible to fish with just a thread \u0026 a hook, the rod makes life much easier for the fishermen. In that context, Dan Bader summed it up well in his article – 3 Reasons Why You Need a Programming Blog.\nBut, if you’ve read some of my previous articles, you would know choosing the right tools to blog is no easy task. I wrote about such a dilemma I was in earlier. Here’s the article – Medium vs Static Site Generators – A Computer Vision Engineer’s Dilemma. Since publishing that article I had time to experiment with existing blogging tools. And I reviewed each of them. You can read the review at – A Review of Some of the Most Popular Static Site Generators.\nSuffice to say, Static Sites Generators did rescue me out of my dilemma.\nStatic sites also comes with added benefit of never having to worry about server maintenance \u0026 security updates. They’re a much better alternative to Wordpress. Besides, they cost almost nothing to produce. You could spend some cash maintaining it, but the financial costs will never be above a few bucks.\nSo, in this article, I’ll show how you can set up a blog with Hugo. The blog will have a CMS, will update itself \u0026 some more OP super powers to add along. So then, without further adieu, let’s dive into setting it up as a Wordpress alternative.\nBut do note, having some prior programming knowledge can be a bonus point but is not a prerequisite. You can follow along with the instructions suggested in this article \u0026 you’ll be fine.\nPrerequisite Tools The star of our article is Hugo. This piece of software is without a doubt one of the easiest to use Static Site Generator available.\nBesides Hugo, we’ll also need a GitHub account to host the articles \u0026 other tools as well. One of those tools include GitHub Actions. Of the many community-maintained GitHub Actions, we’ll be using a couple of them.\nBut no blog can be a Wordpress alternative without a Content Management System (CMS). So, to deliver onto our CMS needs, we’ll use the services from Forestry.\nAnd at last, we’ll use Netlify services to deliver the generated static content. They use a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver the content to our audiences.\nOptionally, we could use Google Analytics (GA) for tracking needs. But if you’re a privacy concerned citizen, use Cloudflare Analytics instead.\nSo, to sum up, here’s the list of all the necessary tools \u0026 services we’ll be using:\nA Github repository to host the articles, themes \u0026 other files required by the tools we’ll be using. A couple of GitHub Actions. peaceiris/actions-hugo to set up Hugo \u0026 generate the static content. nwtgck/actions-netlify to deploy the generated static content. The optional pascalgn/automerge-action to merge Dependabot. This should reduce the need of any manual interventions for security updates. An account on Forestry for the CMS. A Netlify account to deliver the static content to our audiences. And the optional Google/Cloudflare Analytics for tracking needs. So, that said, ensure you’re set up with all the tools mentioned above \u0026 then we can get started.\nUsing Hugo (With All Its Glory) As mentioned earlier, Hugo is without a doubt one of the easiest Static Site Generators available to use. The fact that Hugo has 50K+ stargazers shows how useful it is!\nSo, without wasting any more time, let’s dive into seeing how to use Hugo.\nInstalling Hugo First things first, is to install Hugo on your local machine. Unlike other Static Site Generators Hugo has no dependency! But generators like Pelican, Gatsby and/or Jekyll needs a local Python/Ruby runtime or a JavaScript environment. With Hugo, all you need is the Hugo binary \u0026 you’re good to go.\nThe “installation” procedure is also pretty simple. You need to add the binary to system PATH \u0026 invoke the hugo command from anywhere in the Terminal.\nDo note, editing each Operating System’s PATH is quite different. Hence, do take a thorough look at the official installation docs.\nNow ensure you installed Hugo by running the hugo version command on your CLI. If everything works fine, you should see a similar output.\n1 Hugo Static Site Generator v0.80.0-792EF0F4 windows/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-12-31T13:37:57Z` Creating Your Site I must say, installing Hugo while easy, it isn’t the most fun part of the whole process. So, let’s get started with the fun parts.\nYou can generate a skeleton site (which we’ll build upon soon) with the hugo new site . command. Notice the . (dot) at the end of the command? It tells Hugo to generate the skeleton site in the current directory.\nThe command generates a simple set of files \u0026 folders. Each of them serves a specific purpose for Hugo. Here’s what the directory structure looks like after generating them.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . # Current (or Root) directory ├───archetypes # Stores preconfigured frontmatter metadata. ├───content # Stores your Markdown articles. ├───data # Stores data for used with templates and/or shortcodes ├───layouts # Stores custom code snippets to override the used theme(s). ├───resources # Generated resources (for eg processed images) are stored here. ├───static # Holds static content like CSS/JS files, images, favicons, etc. ├───themes # This is where you download \u0026 store a Hugo theme. └───config.yml # Config file to configure Hugo. Supports YAML, TOML \u0026 JSON formats. There’s more to what Hugo generates as a skeleton site than what I can discuss in one blog. For more info, do take a brief look at the documentation on Hugo’s project directory structure.\nWithout delving into the details of the directory structure, let’s keep things minimal. That way, there’ll be room for further personalization. And you can start delivering content at the earliest as well.\nCreating Content (The Actual Fun Stuff!) As mentioned earlier using Hugo is drop-dead easy. Yet, any given Hugo project can be as complicated as it needs to be. But regardless, you can start writing content right away, all you now need is;\nDownload a theme under the themes directory. Configure Hugo to generate your site with some site metadata for SEO needs in the config.yml file. Write content in Markdown under the content directory. It’s that simple!\nHugo boasts of some 300+ beautiful community maintained themes. You can download a theme to your site’s theme directory \u0026 Hugo will use it to generate the contents of your site. And the easiest way to install a theme is to use “Git Submodules”. That way you can ensure the themes are updated as \u0026 when the theme authors pushes a commit to it’s repository.\nInstalling themes is also very easy. Running the git submodule add themes/ --depth=1 command is enough.\nFor SEO needs, you might also need site metadata. And Hugo takes care of it out-of-the-box. You’ve to configure Hugo with a config.yml file. And in that file you include the necessary details for the metadata. Hugo uses those values to populate the metadata of your site.\nAnd to get a general feel of what a config.yml file looks like, here’s an example;\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 baseURL: \"Your Site URL\" languageCode: \"en-us\" title: \"Your Website Name\" theme: \"Theme Name\" paginate: 5 enableRobotsTXT: true params: env: production title: Your Website Name description: \"Description of your website.\" images: [\"profile-pic.jpg\"] defaultTheme: auto GoogleAnalyticsID: G-V0ZH6RS2BM assets: favicon: icons/favicon.ico menu: main: # Menu items like Contact, About Me pages \u0026 so on Do note, configuring the config.yml isn’t limited to what I mentioned here. Based on the theme you’re using, you might/mightn’t have to extend on it.\nAnd at last, the content directory where you store the Markdown files for your articles. You can organize your Markdown content into subdirectories for easier maintenance \u0026 organization. For example, here’s how mine looks.\n1 2 3 4 5 ./content ├───posts ├ ├───article-1.md ├ ├───article-2.md └───about-me.md The Content Organization section of the docs has more details on the topic. Do check it out for more information.\nAnd with that information, you can start creating content right away.\nBe sure to store all the articles in Markdown format under the content directory. And if you’re not familiar with Markdown, check out Markdown Guide. Else read ahead to figure out how to use the Forestry CMS.\nNow that you’ve started creating content, it’s time for your audience to read them! And the next section is about delivering the content to our audiences..\nDeploying the Blog Unlike Wordpress sites, static sites don’t need a hosting provider (or a server). This alleviates the surface area of potential security \u0026 maintenance mishaps. But without a server to host the content how do we deliver them to our audience?\nThis is where Netlify’s services come handy. They’ll deliver our static content over their global CDN. And their free tier services also come with some nifty goodies. Some of those extra goodies include a domain, a build platform \u0026 many more. But for reasons mentioned later, we won’t use all their services.\nSo, ensure you’ve created a new repo to host your site contents \u0026 a Netlify account to start with. You’ll need to perform a one-time operation on the Netlify dashboard to create a new site. Refer to the Netlify docs to know the exact process to do so.\nThen push your fresh new site to the GitHub repo, you created. And that should trigger a Netlify build operation. You can now view your website at an URL provided by Netlify (you can change it though 😉).\nNow each time you write a new article or push some aesthetic changes to your site, Netlify will trigger a build. While it works \u0026 is fine for most users, there are certain downsides. One of them is the slow \u0026 unoptimized build timings (often taking over 2mins to complete the build). And considering Netlify provides only 300 minutes of build per month, it won’t be long before you run out of it.\nBesides, that way you’re not utilizing Hugo’s full potential. Which is why we’ll use some GitHub Actions instead. With it, we’ll deploy our site \u0026 automate some monotonous tasks as well!\nThe next section delves deeper into why \u0026 how we can achieve such a feat.\nSetting Up Automation \u0026 a CMS Backend Creating \u0026 deploying the site was easy \u0026 fun. But it doesn’t last long (saying from personal experience). More so, when you add the theme as a submodule. You can expect frequent updates for it.\nBut thanks to GitHub’s Dependabot, we can keep our theme(s) updated at all times.\nThere’s also the need for a Content Management System (CMS). What good is a Wordpress Alternative, without a CMS, right? And we should also delegate the build process to GitHub Actions instead of Netlify. This is a more efficient way to deploy \u0026 maintain our site.\nSo that said, let’s list out the remaining features we need to work on \u0026 start working on them one-by-one.\nSetup \u0026 configure Dependabot to keep all dependencies for our site updated.\nSetup \u0026 use Forestry as the CMS backend.\nConfigure \u0026 delegate the build process to GitHub instead of Netlify.\nAllowing Dependabot to Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date GitHub’s Dependabot integration came as a godsend. Because of it, keeping project dependencies up-to-date has never been easier. And guess what? Dependabot can take care of Git Submodules as well! Which means your themes will stay updated as soon as its author pushes some changes to it.\nAnd to configure Dependabot, you need a specific config file for it. This specific file named dependabot.yml stays under the .github directory (create it if it doesn’t exist yet).\nAnd this is how it should look like:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 version: 2 updates: # Update all the GitHub Actions we'll use soon - package-ecosystem: \"github-actions\" directory: \"/\" schedule: interval: \"daily\" time: \"06:00\" labels: [\"github-actions\", \"automerge\"] # Updates all Git Submodules (the theme in this case) - package-ecosystem: \"gitsubmodule\" directory: \"/\" schedule: interval: \"daily\" time: \"06:00\" labels: [\"submodule\", \"automerge\"] With Dependabot configured, it’ll now look for updates every day at 0600 Hours UTC. And if there’s any, it’ll then open a PR with respective labels for GitHub Actions \u0026 Git Submodules each.\nBut that’s pretty much the tip of the iceberg for Dependabot configuration. You can find detailed Dependabot Configuration Options in the official docs.\nWith Dependabot set up, you no longer have to worry about manual update \u0026 maintenance tasks.\nSetting Up Forestry as a CMS Backend No static blog can become a true Wordpress alternative without a CMS. And that’s what makes Wordpress attractive to most users without any technical prowess. And as such, some users might not be comfortable writing their content in Markdown. For them a web-based Rich Text Format environment is what works best.\nHence, we’ll be using Forestry’s backend CMS services. There are alternatives like Contentful (one of the most popular one) \u0026 Netlify CMS. But, from personal experience I found Forestry to be the most easy to setup \u0026 configure.\nThe things you can do with Hugo \u0026 Forestry is beyond the scope of this article. I could write another full-blown article on this topic alone. So, keeping this article rather short \u0026 act as a guide for interested readers, here’s a gist of how to set up Forestry.\nEnsure you’ve Forestry account \u0026 your site is “added” to their services. Configure the settings of the CMS from the Admin panel. Login to your site’s Admin panel by navigating to \u0026 start writing your content in Rich Text (you can write in Markdown as well if you prefer). Forestry has a guide to set up their CMS with Hugo. Do check it out as well!\nAutomation \u0026 Delegating Build Task to GitHub While there’s nothing wrong in using Netlify to build the site, it has some limitations. A major one being, it’s slow \u0026 unoptimized build times (it took over 2mins for my site to build). And with Netlify’s limited 300 build mins per month, it won’t take long before the free quota is used up.\nSo, to make the most out of Hugo’s potential, you should use GitHub Actions. With it, you can build your site in \u003c1 mins (usually takes 20-40 secs on average for mine).\nBesides, compared to Netlify, GitHub provides 2000 build mins per month! So, coupled with less build times \u0026 a huge build mins quota, you won’t have to worry about builds not triggering 😊.\nAlso, having all tools under one roof makes maintenance much easier to handle. So, let’s peruse through what we need to do automate some of the build tasks;\nFirst thing first is to ensure you’ve a netlify.toml config file under the root directory. The Netlify GitHub Action will use it to deploy the website to Netlify’s CDN. The file usually looks something like the following;\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # Post Processing Settings [build.processing] skip_processing = false [build.processing.css] bundle = true minify = true [build.processing.js] bundle = true minify = true [build.processing.html] pretty_urls = true [build.processing.images] compress = true There are more details about the file in the Netlify Config file documentations.\nTo automate some more monotonous tasks, add a build.yml workflow file. Place it under the .github directory. And add the following content to the build.yml file.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 name: Netlify Deploy on: push jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true fetch-depth: 0 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \"0.80.0\" - name: Generate Static Content run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy to Netlify uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v1.1 with: publish-dir: \"./public\" production-branch: dev production-deploy: true github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} deploy-message: \"Deployed with GitHub Actions\" enable-pull-request-comment: true enable-commit-comment: false enable-commit-status: true overwrites-pull-request-comment: true netlify-config-path: ./netlify.toml env: NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }} NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }} timeout-minutes: 1 This file instructs GitHub Actions to use two workflows for deployment tasks. It’ll set up Hugo, generate the static content \u0026 deploy it to Netlify. Further, it’s triggered on every push \u0026 PR event.\nAnd finally, the best piece of automation fun. Automating PR merges opened by Dependabot.\nRemember the automerge labels in the Dependabot config file? This is where they come handy. We’ll use pascalgn/automerge-action to merge any Pull Requests with the label automerge. No need for manual intervention.\nAnd guess what? Dependabot is also configured to update every PR it opens with that label! 😆\nAnd thanks to all the automation features, you no longer have to even open the repository ever again! Automation FTW indeed! 🤣\nFinal Words Phew, that was quite a long read for a tutorial! And if you read it till the end, then thanks for being thorough with it, much appreciated.\nYou might’ve also noticed, the article isn’t as comprehensive. Yet it touches upon all the optimal techniques \u0026 tools used to maintain a programming blog.

right tools to blog is no easy task. I wrote about such a dilemma I was in
earlier. Here&rsquo;s the article &ndash;
<a href=../medium-vs-static-site-generators><em>Medium vs Static Site Generators &ndash; A Computer Vision Engineer&rsquo;s Dilemma</em></a>.
Since publishing that article I had time to experiment with existing blogging
tools. And I reviewed each of them. You can read the review at &ndash;
<a href=../reviewing-popular-static-site-generators><em>A Review of Some of the Most Popular Static Site Generators</em></a>.</p><p>Suffice to say, Static Sites Generators did rescue me out of my dilemma.</p><p>Static sites also comes with added benefit of never having to worry about server
maintenance & security updates. They&rsquo;re a much better alternative to Wordpress.
Besides, they cost almost nothing to produce. You could spend some cash
maintaining it, but the financial costs will never be above a few bucks.</p><p>So, in this article, I&rsquo;ll show how you can set up a blog with Hugo. The blog
will have a CMS, will update itself & some more OP super powers to add along. So
then, without further adieu, let&rsquo;s dive into setting it up as a Wordpress
alternative.</p><p>But do note, having some prior programming knowledge can be a bonus point but is
not a prerequisite. You can follow along with the instructions suggested in this
article & you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p><h2 id=prerequisite-tools>Prerequisite Tools<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#prerequisite-tools>#</a></h2><p>The star of our article is <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. This piece of software is
without a doubt one of the
<a href=../reviewing-popular-static-site-generators/#hugo-the-fastest-static-site-generator-ever-created><em>easiest to use</em></a>
Static Site Generator available.</p><p>Besides Hugo, we&rsquo;ll also need a GitHub account to host the articles & other
tools as well. One of those tools include <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/actions>GitHub Actions</a>.
Of the many community-maintained GitHub Actions, we&rsquo;ll be using a couple of
them.</p><p>But no blog can be a Wordpress alternative without a Content Management System
(CMS). So, to deliver onto our CMS needs, we&rsquo;ll use the services from
<a href=https://forestry.io/>Forestry</a>.</p><p>And at last, we&rsquo;ll use <a href=https://www.netlify.com/>Netlify</a> services to deliver the
generated static content. They use a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to
deliver the content to our audiences.</p><p>Optionally, we could use <a href=https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/>Google Analytics (GA)</a> for tracking
needs. But if you&rsquo;re a privacy concerned citizen, use <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/analytics/>Cloudflare
Analytics</a> instead.</p><p>So, to sum up, here&rsquo;s the list of all the necessary tools & services we&rsquo;ll be
using:</p><ul><li>A Github repository to host the articles, themes & other files required by the
tools we&rsquo;ll be using.</li><li>A couple of GitHub Actions.<ul><li><a href=https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo>peaceiris/actions-hugo</a> to set up Hugo & generate the static
content.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/nwtgck/actions-netlify>nwtgck/actions-netlify</a> to deploy the generated static
content.</li><li>The optional <a href=https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action>pascalgn/automerge-action</a> to merge
Dependabot. This should reduce the need of any manual interventions for
security updates.</li></ul></li><li>An account on <a href=https://forestry.io/>Forestry</a> for the CMS.</li><li>A Netlify account to deliver the static content to our audiences.</li><li>And the optional Google/Cloudflare Analytics for tracking needs.</li></ul><p>So, that said, ensure you&rsquo;re set up with all the tools mentioned above & then we
can get started.</p><h2 id=using-hugo-with-all-its-glory>Using Hugo (With All Its Glory)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#using-hugo-with-all-its-glory>#</a></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Hugo is without a doubt one of the easiest Static Site
Generators available to use. The fact that Hugo has <a href=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/stargazers>50K+
stargazers</a> shows how useful it is!</p><p>So, without wasting any more time, let&rsquo;s dive into seeing how to use Hugo.</p><h3 id=installing-hugo>Installing Hugo<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#installing-hugo>#</a></h3><p>First things first, is to install Hugo on your local machine. Unlike other
Static Site Generators Hugo has no dependency! But generators like
<a href=https://getpelican.com/>Pelican</a>, <a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.com/>Gatsby</a> and/or
<a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a> needs a local Python/Ruby runtime or a JavaScript
environment. With Hugo, all you need is the <a href=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases>Hugo binary</a> &
you&rsquo;re good to go.</p><p>The &ldquo;<em>installation</em>&rdquo; procedure is also pretty simple. You need to add the binary
to system <code>PATH</code> & invoke the <code>hugo</code> command from anywhere in the Terminal.</p><p>Do note, editing each Operating System&rsquo;s PATH is quite different. Hence, do take
a thorough look at the official <a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/>installation
docs</a>.</p><p>Now ensure you installed Hugo by running the <code>hugo version</code> command on your CLI.
If everything works fine, you should see a similar output.</p><div class=highlight><div style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><table style=border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><tr><td style=vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code><span style="white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:.4em;padding:0 .4em;color:#686868">1

in one blog. For more info, do take a brief look at the documentation on Hugo&rsquo;s
<a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/>project directory structure</a>.</p><p>Without delving into the details of the directory structure, let&rsquo;s keep things
minimal. That way, there&rsquo;ll be room for further personalization. And you can
start delivering content at the earliest as well.</p><h3 id=creating-content-the-actual-fun-stuff>Creating Content (The Actual Fun Stuff!)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#creating-content-the-actual-fun-stuff>#</a></h3><p>As mentioned earlier using Hugo is drop-dead easy. Yet, any given Hugo project
can be as complicated as it needs to be. But regardless, you can start writing
content right away, all you now need is;</p><ul><li>Download a theme under the <code>themes</code> directory.</li><li>Configure Hugo to generate your site with some site metadata for SEO needs in
the <code>config.yml</code> file.</li><li>Write content in Markdown under the <code>content</code> directory.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s that simple!</p><p>Hugo boasts of some 300+ beautiful <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/>community maintained themes</a>.
You can download a theme to your site&rsquo;s <code>theme</code> directory & Hugo will use it to
generate the contents of your site. And the easiest way to install a theme is to
use &ldquo;<em>Git Submodules</em>&rdquo;. That way you can ensure the themes are updated as & when
the theme authors pushes a commit to it&rsquo;s repository.</p><p>Installing themes is also very easy. Running the
<code>git submodule add &lt;DOWNLOAD-LINK> themes/&lt;THEME-NAME> --depth=1</code> command is
enough.</p><p>For SEO needs, you might also need site metadata. And Hugo takes care of it
out-of-the-box. You&rsquo;ve to configure Hugo with a <code>config.yml</code> file. And in that
file you include the necessary details for the metadata. Hugo uses those values
to populate the metadata of your site.</p><p>And to get a general feel of what a config.yml file looks like, here&rsquo;s an

server</em>). This alleviates the surface area of potential security & maintenance
mishaps. But without a server to host the content how do we deliver them to our
audience?</p><p>This is where Netlify&rsquo;s services come handy. They&rsquo;ll deliver our static content
over their global CDN. And their free tier services also come with some nifty
goodies. Some of those extra goodies include a domain, a build platform & many
more. But for reasons mentioned later, we won&rsquo;t use all their services.</p><p>So, ensure you&rsquo;ve created a <a href=https://repo.new>new repo</a> to host your site
contents & a <a href=https://www.netlify.com/>Netlify account</a> to start with. You&rsquo;ll need to
perform a one-time operation on the Netlify dashboard to create a new site.
Refer to the Netlify docs to know the <a href=https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git>exact process</a> to do
so.</p><p>Then push your fresh new site to the GitHub repo, you created. And that should
trigger a <a href=https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/>Netlify build operation</a>. You can now view
your website at an URL provided by Netlify (<em>you can change it though</em> 😉).</p><p>Now each time you write a new article or push some aesthetic changes to your
site, Netlify will trigger a build. While it works & is fine for most users,
there are certain downsides. One of them is the slow & unoptimized build timings
(<em>often taking over 2mins to complete the build</em>). And considering Netlify
provides only 300 minutes of build per month, it won&rsquo;t be long before you run
out of it.</p><p>Besides, that way you&rsquo;re not utilizing Hugo&rsquo;s full potential. Which is why we&rsquo;ll
use some GitHub Actions instead. With it, we&rsquo;ll deploy our site & automate some
monotonous tasks as well!</p><p>The next section delves deeper into why & how we can achieve such a feat.</p><h2 id=setting-up-automation--a-cms-backend>Setting Up Automation & a CMS Backend<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#setting-up-automation--a-cms-backend>#</a></h2><p>Creating & deploying the site was easy & fun. But it doesn&rsquo;t last long (<em>saying
from personal experience</em>). More so, when you add the theme as a submodule. You
can expect frequent updates for it.</p><p>But thanks to <a href=https://github.com/dependabot>GitHub&rsquo;s Dependabot</a>, we can keep our theme(s)
updated at all times.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also the need for a Content Management System (CMS). What good is a
Wordpress Alternative, without a CMS, right? And we should also delegate the
build process to GitHub Actions instead of Netlify. This is a more efficient way
to deploy & maintain our site.</p><p>So that said, let&rsquo;s list out the remaining features we need to work on & start
working on them one-by-one.</p><ul><li><p>Setup & configure Dependabot to keep all dependencies for our site updated.</p></li><li><p>Setup & use Forestry as the CMS backend.</p></li><li><p>Configure & delegate the build process to GitHub instead of Netlify.</p></li></ul><h3 id=allowing-dependabot-to-keep-dependencies-up-to-date>Allowing Dependabot to Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#allowing-dependabot-to-keep-dependencies-up-to-date>#</a></h3><p>GitHub&rsquo;s Dependabot integration came as a godsend. Because of it, keeping
project dependencies up-to-date has never been easier. And guess what?
Dependabot can take care of Git Submodules as well! Which means your themes will
stay updated as soon as its author pushes some changes to it.</p><p>And to configure Dependabot, you need a specific config file for it. This
specific file named <code>dependabot.yml</code> stays under the <code>.github</code> directory
(<em>create it if it doesn&rsquo;t exist yet</em>).</p><p>And this is how it should look like:</p><div class=highlight><div style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><table style=border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><tr><td style=vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code><span style="white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:.4em;padding:0 .4em;color:#686868"> 1

</span></span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></div><p>With Dependabot configured, it&rsquo;ll now look for updates every day at 0600 Hours
UTC. And if there&rsquo;s any, it&rsquo;ll then open a PR with respective labels for GitHub
Actions & Git Submodules each.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s pretty much the tip of the iceberg for Dependabot configuration. You
can find detailed <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates><em>Dependabot Configuration Options</em></a> in the
official docs.</p><p>With Dependabot set up, you no longer have to worry about manual update &
maintenance tasks.</p><h3 id=setting-up-forestry-as-a-cms-backend>Setting Up Forestry as a CMS Backend<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#setting-up-forestry-as-a-cms-backend>#</a></h3><p>No static blog can become a true <em>Wordpress alternative</em> without a CMS. And
that&rsquo;s what makes Wordpress attractive to most users without any technical
prowess. And as such, some users might not be comfortable writing their content
in Markdown. For them a web-based <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format>Rich Text Format</a>
environment is what works best.</p><p>Hence, we&rsquo;ll be using Forestry&rsquo;s backend CMS services. There are alternatives
like <a href=https://www.contentful.com/>Contentful</a> (<em>one of the most popular one</em>) & <a href=https://www.netlifycms.org/>Netlify
CMS</a>. But, from personal experience I found Forestry to be the most
easy to setup & configure.</p><p>The things you can do with Hugo & Forestry is beyond the scope of this article.
I could write another full-blown article on this topic alone. So, keeping this
article rather short & act as a guide for interested readers, here&rsquo;s a gist of
how to set up Forestry.</p><ol><li>Ensure you&rsquo;ve Forestry account & your site is &ldquo;<em>added</em>&rdquo; to their services.</li><li>Configure the settings of the CMS from the Admin panel.</li><li>Login to your site&rsquo;s Admin panel by navigating to <code>&lt;YOUR-SITE-URL/admin></code> &
start writing your content in Rich Text (<em>you can write in Markdown as well
if you prefer</em>).</li></ol><p>Forestry has a <a href=https://forestry.io/docs/guides/developing-with-hugo/>guide</a> to set up their CMS with Hugo. Do
check it out as well!</p><h3 id=automation--delegating-build-task-to-github>Automation & Delegating Build Task to GitHub<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#automation--delegating-build-task-to-github>#</a></h3><p>While there&rsquo;s nothing wrong in using Netlify to build the site, it has some
limitations. A major one being, it&rsquo;s slow & unoptimized build times (<em>it took
over 2mins for my site to build</em>). And with Netlify&rsquo;s limited 300 build mins per
month, it won&rsquo;t take long before the free quota is used up.</p><p>So, to make the most out of Hugo&rsquo;s potential, you should use GitHub Actions.
With it, you can build your site in &lt;1 mins (<em>usually takes 20-40 secs on
average for mine</em>).</p><p>Besides, compared to Netlify, GitHub provides 2000 build mins per month! So,
coupled with less build times & a huge build mins quota, you won&rsquo;t have to worry
about builds not triggering 😊.</p><p>Also, having all tools under one roof makes maintenance much easier to handle.
So, let&rsquo;s peruse through what we need to do automate some of the build tasks;</p><ol><li><p>First thing first is to ensure you&rsquo;ve a <code>netlify.toml</code> config file under the
root directory. The Netlify GitHub Action will use it to deploy the website
to Netlify&rsquo;s CDN.

It&rsquo;ll set up Hugo, generate the static content & deploy it to Netlify.
Further, it&rsquo;s triggered on every push & PR event.</p></li><li><p>And finally, the best piece of automation fun. Automating PR merges opened by
Dependabot.</p><p>Remember the <code>automerge</code> labels in the Dependabot config file? This is where
they come handy. We&rsquo;ll use <a href=https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action><code>pascalgn/automerge-action</code></a>
to merge any Pull Requests with the label <code>automerge</code>. No need for manual
intervention.</p><p>And guess what? Dependabot is also configured to update every PR it opens
with that label! 😆</p></li></ol><p>And thanks to all the automation features, you no longer have to even open the
repository ever again! Automation FTW indeed! 🤣</p><h2 id=final-words>Final Words<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#final-words>#</a></h2><p>Phew, that was quite a long read for a tutorial! And if you read it till the
end, then thanks for being thorough with it, much appreciated.</p><p>You might&rsquo;ve also noticed, the article isn&rsquo;t as comprehensive. Yet it touches
upon all the optimal techniques & tools used to maintain a programming blog. So,
I hope the information I shared through this article was enough to get you
started with your blog as well! If you do so, reach out to me & say &ldquo;<em>Hi! Here&rsquo;s
my blog.</em>&rdquo; over social media and/or email. And I might give away a shoutout for
you.</p><p>Besides, my blog is <a href=https://github.com/Jarmos-san/blog>open-sourced</a>! ❤ So, if you stumble
